Create a class that computes the Top 10 traffic receivers, Top 10 traffic transmitters, top 3 used protocols, and top 10 used applications using NetFlow data taken from the supplied archive(attached CSV file).

Using time range as an Input parameter for this method, calculate data for and numbers for traffic, protocols and application counts.

The input of NetFlow data should be handled by its own class, called from the above method.

Output can be any structure containing the results of the computation.

Serialize computation results to a JSON string and save to a file.

Using computation results make a GUI window with a chart for received and transmitted bytes over time for top network transmitter and receiver. You can use any graph or chart libraries that you wish.
